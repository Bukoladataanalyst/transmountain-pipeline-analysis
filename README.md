# TransMountain Pipeline Utilization Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes pipeline utilization and product distribution for the TransMountain, Enbridge, and Keystone pipelines during the Canadian oil boom period (2007–2014).

The goal was to understand capacity usage trends, trade patterns, and comparative performance across major pipelines using SQL and data visualization.

## Tools Used
- SQL Server
- Power BI
- Excel
- GitHub

## Data Source
Open Canada

## Key Business Questions
•	How did the Transmountain Pipeline Oil Production fare alongside 2 major pipelines ( Enbridge and Keystone) in the last oil boom period of 2007 to 2014?
 
•	How are the Transmountain pipeline products distributed between IntraCanada and Exports?

## Methodology
1. Data extracted using SQL (joins, aggregations, CASE statements)
2. Cleaned and validated results
3. Visualized trends using Power BI
4. Interpreted findings from a business and policy perspective

## Key Insights
- Pipeline utilization increased significantly during peak oil boom years.
- Export volumes grew faster than domestic consumption.
- Capacity constraints varied across pipelines.
